# Djikstra-Implementation-in-a-maze-
Created a 1200 x 500 maze with obstacles and solved using Djikstra algorithm

<<<<<<< HEAD
Libraries used : import heapq as hq import time import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import matplotlib.patches as patches import numpy as np

On running the program, the prompt asks for start and goal x, y positions. If any of the positions are outside the arena. The prompt asks to specify the initial and goal points again.

I have given an offset of 5 for all the shapes and the arena limits so follwing are the minimum and maximum arena points: minimum_x, minimum_y = 6, 6 maximum_x, maximum_y = 1194, 494
